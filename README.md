# [One Line Hacks](https://connorrothschild.github.io/one-line-hacks/)

A collection of random utilities that I find myself Googling too often. 
 
## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
